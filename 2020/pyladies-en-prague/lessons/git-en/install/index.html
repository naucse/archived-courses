<h1>Git</h1>
<p>There is another program that we will install and that will later let us cooperate
and develop programs together with other people. It's called Git.
Let's install it and set it up.</p>
<p>The installation procedure is different for different operating systems, so choose yours.</p>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>In Linux, we can install it with one command:</p>
<p><strong>Fedora, RHEL</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>sudo dnf install git git gui nano
</pre></div><p><strong>Ubuntu, Debian</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>sudo apt-get install git git-gui nano
</pre></div><p>If you are using some other distribution we expect that you already know
how to install programs. Go ahead and install <em>git</em>, <em>gitk</em>, <em>git gui</em> and <em>nano</em>.</p>
<p>After you have installed git, choose your Git editor.
If you do not like Vim (or you do not know what it is)
enter this command to choose a more user-friendly editor called Nano:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git config - global core.editor nano
</pre></div><p>Continue with the general <a href="#config">settings</a> below.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://git-scm.org">git-scm.org</a>, download Git and install it.
When installing, select these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt</li>
<li>Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not change any other options.</p>
<p>Then set your Git editor.
If you have a terminal window open, close it, and open a new one.
(The installation changes system settings which have to be loaded again.)
In the new command line, enter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt; </span>git config - global core.editor notepad
<span class="gp">&gt; </span>git config --global format.commitMessageColumns <span class="m">80</span>
<span class="gp">&gt; </span>git config - global gui.encoding utf-8
</pre></div><p>Now go to <a href="#config">Settings</a> below.</p>
<h2>macOS</h2>
<p>Try to run <code>git</code> on the command line.
If it's already installed, it will show you how to use it.
Otherwise, install it using Homebrew:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>brew install git
</pre></div><p>It is still necessary to set up your Git editor (enter <code>nano</code>,
even if you installed for example Atom during the installation of the editor).
You do that with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git config - global core.editor nano
</pre></div><p>Continue with the general settings:</p>
<p><a id="config"></a></p>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>Several people can collaborate in one project in Git.
To track who make a specific change, we need to
tell Git our name and e-mail.
At the command prompt, enter the following commands, but change the
name and address to yours:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git config --global user.name <span class="s2">&quot;Adéla Novotná&quot;</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>git config --global user.email adela.novotna@example.com
</pre></div><p>You can of course use a nickname or even
fake email, but then it will be more complicated to
engage in team projects.
Anyway, your name and email can be changed at any time
by typing the configuration commands again.</p>
<div class="admonition note"><p>If you are afraid of spam, do not worry.
Your e-mail address can be viewed only by people who download the project
to which you contributed.
Spammers mostly focus on less technically capable people than Git users. :)</p>
</div><p>You can also set up color listings - if you don't think
(like some Git authors) that the command line should be black and white:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git config --global color.ui <span class="nb">true</span>
</pre></div><div class="admonition note"><p>Running <code>git config</code> does not print any message that the operation was successful.
This is normal; many other commands behave like that, for example <code>cd</code>.</p>
<p>You can check your current git configuration with the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git config --global --list
<span class="go">user.name=Adéla Novotná</span>
<span class="go">user.email=adela.novotna@example.com</span>
</pre></div></div><p>And that's all! You have installed Git. Congratulations!</p>
