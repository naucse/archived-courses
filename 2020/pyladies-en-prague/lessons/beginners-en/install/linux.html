<h1>Python installation on Linux</h1>
<p>Installing Python on Linux is actually easy.
The only difficult part could be that there are many distributions that
needs different installation commands.</p>
<h2>Python 3</h2>
<p>First chech in your <a href="naucse:page?lesson=beginners/cmdline">command line</a>
if you don't already have python3 installed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>python3 --version
</pre></div><p>If there will appear "Python" and version number (e. g. <code>Python 3.5.2</code>)
and the version is higher than 3.4 you are done here so continue with
other section <a href="#check-tkinter"><code>tkinter</code> check</a>.</p>
<p>If there will be "Python" and version lower than 3.3, ask coach.</p>
<p>If <code>bash: python3: command not found</code> or something similar will appear
you will have to install Python3.
Command depends on your distribution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fedora:<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>sudo dnf install python3
</pre></div></li>
<li>Ubuntu:<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>sudo apt-get install python3
</pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using some other distribution we expect that you already know
how to install programs. If not try to ask Google.</p>
<p><a id="install-conda"></a></p>
<h2>conda installation</h2>
<p>For conda installation use <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html">this link</a> and choose Anaconda.</p>
<p>Then you have to add full path to /......./Continuum/anaconda3/Scripts (instead of
dots there will be something different regarding where you installed it)
to your environment variable PATH - try to find out by yourself (but if you will have
some troubles contact us). You will know that it's been added successfully by typing into 
your command line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>conda --help
</pre></div><p>After successful installation follow how to <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html">create virtual environment</a></p>
