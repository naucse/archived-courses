<h1>Python installation for Windows</h1>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the Python website</a> and 
download the latest stable version of Python. From version 3.6.0.
there are some enhancements for Windows so download only version
 <strong>3.6.0 and above</strong>.</p>
<p>How to know which installer is the right one?
If your computer has 64bit Windows then download <em>Windows x86-64 executable installer</em>.
If your Windows is only 32bit download <em>Windows x86 executable installer</em>.</p>
<div class="admonition note"><p>If you don't know what Windows version do you have just open <strong>Start</strong>, 
search <strong>System</strong> and open <strong>System information</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="figure"><a href="naucse:static?filename=windows_32v64-bit.png"><img src="naucse:static?filename=windows_32v64-bit.png" alt="Windows version"></a></span></p>
</div><p>Then you can run the installer.
In the beginning check <strong>Install launcher for all Users</strong>
and also <strong>Add Python 3.6 to PATH</strong>.
This will make creating venv much easier.</p>
<p>(If you don't have admin rights don't check <em>Install launcher for all Users</em>.)</p>

<p>Then click <strong>Install now</strong> and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>If you have your command line open, close it and open again.</p>
<h2>conda installation</h2>
<p>For conda installation use <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html">this link</a> and choose Anaconda.</p>
<p>Then you have to add full path to C:\.......\Continuum\anaconda3\Scripts (instead of
dots there will be something different regarding where you installed it) to your 
environment variable PATH - try to find out by yourself (but if you will have some 
troubles contact us). You will know that it's been added successfully by typing into 
your command line:</p>
