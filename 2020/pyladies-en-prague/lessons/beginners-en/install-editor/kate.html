– e. g. <code>.py</code> for Python.</p>
<p>So it's better if you save your file as early as possible.</p>
</dd></dl><h2>Indentation practice</h2>
<p>As we already mentioned it's important in Python by how much spaces
is line indented. So we will have to learn to quickly indent block
of text.</p>
<p>First of all copy following text into your editor.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code>OPHELIA:
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?
HAMLET:
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
OPHELIA:
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
I pray you, now receive them.
HAMLET:
No, not I;
I never gave you aught.
OPHELIA:
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.</code></pre></div><p><small>Hamlet, W. Shakespeare</small></p>
<p>This text is not well-arranged so we will indent it like that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code>OPHELIA:
