<p>What happened? Python "printed out" <code>Hello, world!</code> for you. It's an old programming tradition, going back to ~1970s. It is a traditional first command executed by people who are learning a given programming language, which illustrates the basic syntax of the language. In python one can simply execute <code>print("Hello, world!")</code>. In other programming languages it might not be that simple! Feel free to search for examples of a "Hello world" code in C++, Java, HTML, JavaScript or other languages.</p>
