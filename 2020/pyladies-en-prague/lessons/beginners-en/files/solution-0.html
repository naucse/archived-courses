<p>Each row ends with a newline character (<code>'\n'</code>).
When iterating over a Python file, 
this character remains at the end of the string <code>line</code> ยน.
The <code>print()</code> function then adds another newline character. 
This function always ends the line. 
You can suppress it using the argument <code>end=''</code>).
That is one way how to "fix" this extra spacing. 
The other is to use the method <code>rstrip()</code> for each line. 
This method removes all spaces and newline characters 
that are the end of the string.</p>
<hr>
<p>ยน  Why does Python keep the newline character? If the <code>'\n'</code> at the end of line was removed, 
it would not be possible to know if the last line ended with <code>'\n'</code> or not.</p>
