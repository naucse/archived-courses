<p>On Linux, Gedit is installed like any other program.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, in Python it is important how many spaces a line starts with.
Therefore, it will be useful for us to know how to quickly indent blocks of text.
Let's see how to do it.</p>
<p>Copy this text into the editor:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code>OPHELIA:
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?
HAMLET:
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
OPHELIA:
My lord, I have remembrances of yours
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
I pray you, now receive them.
HAMLET:
No, not I.
I never gave you aught.
OPHELIA:
My honour’d lord, you know right well you did,
And with them words of so sweet breath compos’d
As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.</code></pre></div><p>(An excerpt from <em>Hamlet</em> by W. Shakespeare)</p>
<p>This text is not very clear, so we will try to space it out to make it look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code>OPHELIA:
    Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
HAMLET:
    I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
OPHELIA:
    My lord, I have remembrances of yours
    That I have longed long to re-deliver.
    I pray you, now receive them.
HAMLET:
    No, not I.
    I never gave you aught.
OPHELIA:
    My honour’d lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath compos’d
    As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.</code></pre></div><p>To indent one line, set the cursor at the beginning of the line and press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.
Each time you press it, the line will be indented by 4 spaces.</p>
<p>If you indent too much, you can reduce the indentation using <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.</p>
<p>If you want to indent multiple lines at once, select them all and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>. You can also "unindent" the whole selection using <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.</p>
<p>And that's it! Now you not only have the editor set up, but you also know how to use it.</p>
