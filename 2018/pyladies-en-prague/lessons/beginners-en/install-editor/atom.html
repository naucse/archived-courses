<h1>Instalace  Atom</h1>
<p>Download Atom
from its <a href="https://atom.io">webpage</a>
and install it.</p>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>You don't have to set up anything in Atom.</p>
<p>Indentation and colouring, how we want it, works only with files with <code>.py</code>
extension.</p>
<p>So it's better if you save your file as early as possible.</p>
<h2>Code style</h2>
<p>There is just one thing missing in Atom: plug-in for checking
code style</p>
<p>As every written language Python also has its typographic rules.
You can find them here in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> document.</p>
<p>If you don't want to remember them just install plug-in which will always
notice you if you violate some.</p>
<p>Firstly we will have to install special library which takes care of this.
Write into your command line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>python -m pip install flake8
</pre></div><p>And now just install the plug-in.
In the main menu choose "File &gt; Settings" and click on "Install".
Then search for "linter-flake8" and in the list click "Install" next to
the "linter-flake8". You will be also asked for installation of every 
dependency.</p>
<h2>Indentation practice</h2>
<p>As we already mentioned it's important in Python by how much spaces
is line indented. So we will have to learn to quickly indent block
of text.</p>
<p>First of all copy following text into your editor.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code>OPHELIA:
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?
HAMLET:
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
OPHELIA:
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
I pray you, now receive them.
HAMLET:
No, not I;
I never gave you aught.
OPHELIA:
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.</code></pre></div><p><small>Hamlet, W. Shakespeare</small></p>
<p>This text is not well-arranged so we will indent it like that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code>OPHELIA:
    Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?
HAMLET:
    I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
OPHELIA:
    My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
    That I have longed long to re-deliver;
    I pray you, now receive them.
HAMLET:
    No, not I;
    I never gave you aught.
OPHELIA:

    And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
    As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.</code></pre></div><p>To indent one line set you coursor in the beginning of the line
and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
With every press you will indent the like by 4 spaces.</p>
<p>If you indent too much, press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.</p>
<p>If you would want to indent more lines just highlight them and
press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
For undo press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.</p>
