<h1>Who are PyLadies?</h1>
<p>An international group of people trying to involve women in the Python programming community.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>About 10-15% of programmers are women. That's very little. It's not that women are stupid or 
awkward or have no logical thinking. They are discouraged by other things; 
a lots of small details that create a not very friendly environment. 
PyLadies are trying to solve this problem, for example by creating an environment 
that is more enjoyable for new programmers.</p>
<h2>PyLadies in Czechia</h2>
<ul>
<li>2012 - there was a Django workshop (Python framework for web pages) during the Ruby on Rails
(another programming language) conference.</li>
<li>2013 - The first PyLadies course (for free) in Brno -- the first course that had own 
open-source materials</li>
<li>2015 - this course also started in Prague</li>
<li>2016 - PyLadies in Ostrava</li>
<li>2018 - PyLadies in Pilsen, Hradec Kralove, and the first English (translated) version of the 
Czech course - the first open-source materials (at least as we know) by volunteers from CA Technologies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What will you learn here?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic programming: variables, data types, conditions, loops, functions, exceptions, modules, ...</li>
<li>Skills connected with programming: command line, version control, collaboration, and open-source</li>
<li>Games: text games and also some graphic games</li>
</ul>

<h2>What shouldn't you expect?</h2>
<ul>
<li>an IT course</li>
<li>PyLadies do not require knowledge of advanced mathematics or graph theory. 
If you are interested in these topics, we recommend studying computer science instead of 
attending this course.</li>
<li>This is also not a course like Django Girls, RailsGirls, or Czechitas that are focused on
creating web pages.</li>
<li>And finally, PyLadies are not the course - PyLadies are the ones preparing the course :)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Coaches</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are here in our free time - volunteering</li>
<li>We will help you if you have a problem</li>
<li>We shouldn't touch your keyboard (so each time we try to do this, you should slap our fingers :) )</li>
<li>How to contact us: Marketa.Muzikova(at)ca.com, Vsevolod.Khanin(at)ca.com, Atul.Sharma(at)ca.com,
Charalampos.Polychronakis(at)ca.com, Alexandru.Dumitru(at)ca.com </li>
<li>Join our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pyladies.prague.english/">Facebook group</a> where you can
ask us anything. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Red and Green post-its</h2>
<p>During our lessons we will use red and green post-its. When we are doing an exercise and
you finish it successfully -- stick the green paper on the right upper corner of your screen 
so everyone can see it. If however you encounter ANY problem, stick the red (pink, actually) 
post-it on your screen and someone will help you.</p>
<ul>
<li>RED POST-IT: I have a problem, please help me!</li>
<li>GREEN POST-IT: I have successfully finished the exercise :)</li>
</ul>
<p>We won't continue until everyone has a green post-it on their laptop's screen.</p>
<h2>What to do after this course?</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will need to practice a lot so you don't forget everything</li>
<li>At this time, we can't promise anything, we want to do some workshops on advanced topics,
but as I said -- we can't promise anything</li>
<li>You can also practice and learn some advanced stuff (e. g. algorithms, data structures) 
at <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard">Hackerrank</a></li>
<li>There are also a lot of games where you practice by "coding" a game (the beginnings are
not really hard, they will give you a foundation) - e.g. <a href="https://www.codingame.com/start">Coding game</a>,
<a href="https://codecombat.com/">Code combat</a>, <a href="https://checkio.org/">Checkio</a>, <a href="http://www.cyber-dojo.org/">Cyber Dojo</a>,
<a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Code Wars</a></li>
<li>Once a month there is <a href="https://pyvo.cz/praha-pyvo/">Pyvo</a>, some lightning talks are in English</li>
<li>You can go to <a href="https://pyworking.cz/">PyWorking</a>, but it's mostly in Czech</li>
<li>If you have a project in mind, you can go to <a href="https://pyworking.cz/">Meetups</a> (right side
of the page) where surely someone speaks English</li>
<li>Or you can read some books - I recommend to follow <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> where
they once offered a bundle with books, videos, and some software for Python development, or books about how 
to develop games with Python. Currently (25.9. - 9.10.2018) there is a <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/learn-you-some-code-books">bundle</a> 
that includes the great book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" for just €0.75, or you buy many more
books about different programming languages including "Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction 
to Programming" for €12.74 (this one is on Amazon for €19.49).</li>
</ul>

And now, the coaches will introduce themselves. (Once they finish, it will be your turn, so 
think about what you want to say -- your name, why you want to learn python, ...?)</p>
